# Website for _Real Estate_ price prediction using Machine Learning model

## **Motivation**
_I constructed this project with personal improvement in mind; it would be beneficial to both me and others to develop something that can be used by someone._

## **Description**
_First, I created a model with sklearn and linear regression using the Bangalore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. The second step would be to create a Python Flask server that serves http requests using the stored model. The third component is a website developed in html, CSS, and javascript that allows users to enter information such as home square footage, bedrooms, and so on, and then calls a Python Flask server to receive the anticipated price._
