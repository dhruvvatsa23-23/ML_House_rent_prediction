# Website for _Real Estate_ price prediction using Machine Learning model

## _Motivation_ 
I constructed this project with personal improvement in mind; it would be beneficial to both me and others to develop something that can be used by someone.

## Description
I have first built a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
